#First, you'll need to initialize the weights. We want these to be small such that the input to the sigmoid is in the linear region near 0 and not squashed at the high and low ends. It's also important to initialize them randomly so that they all have different starting values and diverge, breaking symmetry. So, we'll initialize the weights from a normal distribution centered at 0. A good value for the scale is 1/sqrt(â€‹n) where n is the number of input units. This keeps the input to the sigmoid low for increasing numbers of input units.

# NumPy provides a function that calculates the dot product of two arrays, which conveniently calculates h for us. The dot product multiplies two arrays element-wise, the first element in array 1 is multiplied by the first element in array 2, and so on. Then, each product is summed.
